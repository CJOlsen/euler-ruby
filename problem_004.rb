# Problem 4
# Author: Christopher Olsen


# A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made 
# from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
#
# Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.


# The Plan:
# Check every combination (all 899*899 of them), check each for palindrome,
# keep the largest.  (No fancy palindrome properties here...)

          largest = sum
